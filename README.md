XPC and Objective C and Swift and...

## The Ask:

> We'd like you to create a simple app for browsing files on your Mac, with an XPC Service 
> that collects some details on each item. The purpose of the service will be only to demonstrate 
> how it can collect data in another process, and communicate that back to the app. It could be 
> something that you would normally simply do in the app itself. Ideally, you should be able to 
> see a preview of something like a photo, as you would in Finder. We will leave the 
> rest of the details and what the app does to you, but we would like you to attempt to 
> make this as modern in appearance as possible.
